# DictionaryApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.9.
The dictionary application is a simple client-side application made using Angular. This
application is a small-scale application/single page application that can be used to
search the meaning of the word in the list of the languages provided. It can also
translate the word given in any language and provides it synonyms as well. We have
used Yandex API as our backend and frontend application that we have created by
ourselves. Main Functionality of the application is to take the word given any language
and provide the meanings and synonyms of that word in the other chosen language. For
the front end design Bootstrap was used and for the backend communication Angular
was used.
